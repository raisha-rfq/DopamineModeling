# Simulation of Dopamine Release due to Social Media Attachment
## Introduction:
The past decade saw social media dominating every aspect of communication, sharing, and consummation. There is an influx of overabundant content providers like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter that beckon users towards an addiction cycle of constant scrolling and instant gratification. This attachment behavior is quite closely tied to the brains' reward system; in other words, it is the release of dopamine —a neurotransmitter that has direct relations with pleasure and reward-when one engages with social media.<br>
Dopamine is the molecule that plays an essential role in the reinforcement of behaviors. Much  of the time spent on specific activities, such as how many hours people spend on social media, will be highly rewarding; this leads to habitual and compulsive behavior. The type of constant  association of dopamine especially in the context of inputs such as notifications, likes, and new content would create a feedback loop where users encourage themselves to keep scrolling for   more instant rewards. This will eventually lead to a diminished attention span and tendency towards addiction, for the brain has grown accustomed to those dopamine "fixes".<br>
This project explores into the neurobiological mechanisms behind this phenomenon. It examines how social media stimulates dopamine release and alters neuronal activity, particularly in individuals with varying levels of attachment to these platforms. By comparing the brain's response between healthy users and those exhibiting excessive use, we aim to uncover patterns of dopamine release and neuronal activity associated with this behavior. This research could enhance our understanding of the cognitive and mental health impacts of social media, shedding light on its effects on attention and emotional well-being.
 
## Objectives
1.	Simulating Dopamine Release and Neural Responses:<br>
To develop a simulation replicating the dopamine release and neuronal firing patterns triggered by stimuli mimicking social media scrolling.
2.	Comparing Neural Activity in Healthy vs. Attached Users:<br>
To analyze and contrast neural activity patterns between healthy individuals and those exhibiting heightened attachment to social media, focusing on differences in firing rates and recovery patterns.
3.	Studying Dopamine Decay and Firing Rate Recovery:<br>
To investigate the rate at which dopamine concentrations decay and how neuronal activity returns to baseline, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social media attachment.

## Model description:
The fire-and-integrate model is a simple and powerful framework used to simulate the dynamics of neuron firing and dopamine release in response to stimuli, such as social media interactions. In this model, the neuron's membrane potential accumulates inputs over time, and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the neuron "fires," resulting in dopamine release. The model integrates key factors such as stochastic reward processes (unpredictable social media feedback), attention mechanisms (frequency of interactions), and desensitization (tolerance to rewards over time).
