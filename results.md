# Interpretation:
Neurons' Membrane Potentials : There are 10 dopamine neurons; the plots have membrane potentials of voltage vs. time. A spike will occur when the membrane potential is roughly -55 mV: Subsequently, it jumps up to about -65 mV. Neurons that frequently cross are activated more and undergo more spikes. Neurons that very rarely cross are minimally active. Based on independent social media reward inputs, variability between neurons is expected; more neurons with higher reward inputs should spike. <br>

Input Currents: Input currents for neurons are reward-driven, like social media. This is simulated using a Poisson process with a rate of 0.1. The input fluctuates around 5 nA and jumps to 15-30 nA when rewards occur, simulating dopamine signaling. Neurons with higher currents are more likely to spike because their membrane potential will easily cross the threshold.<br>

Neuron-Specific Differences: Each neuron receives independent inputs, which causes variations in spiking behavior. The neurons that receive more frequent rewards spike more, and the ones that receive fewer rewards spike less. The total spike count reflects how each neuron responds to the social media-like rewards.<br>

Overall Meaning: The model is simulated response of dopamine neurons to the reward from social media. Greater or larger rewards are associated with stronger dopamine signaling and more spikes, which implies higher engagement or emotional response. Those getting frequent spikes could potentially get a higher emotional or motivational response through the social media, while others would be less driven or less engaging.<br>

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter in reward systems, is associated with pleasure and motivation. In the context of social media, spikes in dopamine are created by feedback loops such as likes or comments that reinforce behaviors. This model explains how social media rewards drive behavior through dopamine, potentially increasing engagement or addiction for those receiving more frequent rewards.<br>


# Conclusion:
•	Social media rewards could make neuron activity stronger with the use of positive reinforcement over time. <br>
•	Individual differences is a reason why people react differently to a given stimulus, such as social media rewards.<br>
•	Implication at the real-world level leads to the conclusion that frequent rewards may lead to stronger dopamine-driven motivation of people, with some becoming more immersed or addicted to social media.
